= pipe my egg

A command-line pomodoro timer that's designed to be integrated into your status bar.

You can view an online demo here: http://aecepoglu.github.io/pipe-my-egg

== Integrations

By example I'll showcase how it integrates with https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar] and https://github.com/geommer/yabar[yabar], but it can be integrated with any status-bar application that can follow the output of a command.

Polybar Configuration: ~/.config/polybar/config
[source,ini]
----
[module/pomodoro]
type = custom/script

exec = "pomodoro"
tail = true

click-middle = echo 'play' >> /tmp/pipe2egg.sock
scroll-down = echo 'next' >> /tmp/pipe2egg.sock
----

Yabar Configuration: ~/.config/yabar/yabar.conf
----
pomodoro: {
	exec: "pomodoro";
	type: "persist";
	command-button2: "echo 'play' >> /tmp/pipe2egg.sock";
	command-button4: "echo 'next' >> /tmp/pipe2egg.sock";
}
----

== Usage

.In a terminal window
----
pomodoro
----

And the pomodoro application will start listening to messages on the named pipe `/tmp/pipemyegg.sock`.
The messages you can send are documented in the <<states-and-messages,States & Messages>> section

.In a different terminal window
----
echo 'play' >> /tmp/pipemyegg.sock
